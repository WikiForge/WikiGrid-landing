### 2.1 Unauthorized Material

In the event of unauthorized copyrighted material being found hosted on Services provided by WikiGrid, you may report the content to us via email to staff [at] wikigrid [dot] com. We strive to comply with the provisions outlined in the DMCA, which addresses copyright infringement on the internet. 

As the enforcement action and liability generally lie with the copyright holder under Section 512 of the DMCA, we hold no obligation to act on copyright requests unless requested by the copyright holder. WikiGrid will act on complaints if it determines an unreasonable or unacceptable delay in handling non-legal requests to protect creative rights.

We encourage all users to respect intellectual property rights and ensure that any content uploaded to Services complies with copyright laws. If you believe your copyrighted material has been used inappropriately on our Services, please provide us with the necessary information to process your complaint, including:

Upon receipt of a valid copyright infringement notification, we will promptly investigate the matter and take appropriate actions, which may include removing or disabling access to the infringing material. We may also notify the user who posted the allegedly infringing material and provide them with an opportunity to respond. We may also provide a copy of any correspondence sent, minus confidential details.

## 7. Content

Under no circumstances are you permitted to submit information to WikiGrid that is illegal to display, distribute, or disseminate in the United States. Additionally, WikiGrid does not host the following types of content:

### 7.1 Unsubstantiated Insults, Hate, or Rumors Against Individuals or Groups

Content on wikis must be fairly balanced, meaningful, or substantiated by independent referencing. Wikis with a clearly identifiable comedic or satirical value are exempt from needing to substantiate claims as long as they provide relevant content. Exceptions for comedy/satire do not cover derogatory language based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, age, disability, or other marginalized groups.

### 7.2 Toxic Communities

This includes wikis where there have been repeated personal attacks, harassment of users, "doxing," hate speech, and where local administrators have ignored, enabled, or done little to stop such behavior.

### 7.3 Lascivious Content Involving Minors

WikiGrid does not permit content of a sexual nature involving minors, including written, real images, and animated/fictional material. Exceptions may include discussions or references to outside content, provided these are legal under U.S. law and not the primary focus of the wiki.

### 7.4 Promoting Violence, Hatred, or Harassment

Content promoting violence or hatred against individuals or groups based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, age, disability, or other factors is not allowed. Exceptions apply when such terms are relevant to documenting events (e.g., controversies over their use in literature).

### 7.5 Deception, Fraud, or Misleading Content

Wikis that intentionally deceive, defraud, or mislead users are prohibited. This includes misrepresenting health claims that could harm public health or impersonating individuals or organizations. However, wikis that make their fictional or satirical intent clear are exempt.

### 7.6 Impacting Other Wikis Negatively

Wikis that engage in behavior such as hate speech, denial-of-service attacks, violent content, or discussions of illegal activities may create conditions that penalize other wikis (e.g., SEO issues, domain blacklisting). WikiGrid reserves the right to terminate such wikis.

## 8. Global Conduct

When using our Services, all users are expected to act in a manner that furthers a wiki's purpose. The following behaviors are prohibited:

### 8.1 Harassment

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

- Personal attacks, threats of violence, or intimidation.
- Offensive or discriminatory comments.
- Unwanted public or private communication or stalking.
- Disclosure of private information without consent.
- Publishing private communications inappropriately.

### 8.2 Hate Speech

Using derogatory language based on race, gender, sexual orientation, or similar factors is strictly prohibited.

### 8.3 Personal Threats

Threats of violence, injury, or harm are not tolerated, even if below legal thresholds.

## 9. Links

WikiGrid has not reviewed all linked sites and is not responsible for their content. The inclusion of a link does not imply endorsement by WikiGrid, and use of such sites is at your own risk.

## 10. Site Terms of Service Modifications

WikiGrid reserves the right to revise these Terms of Service at any time without notice. By using the Site, you agree to be bound by the current version of these Terms of Service.

## 11. Governing Law

Any claim relating to WikiGrid's website shall be governed by the laws of Kootenai County, Idaho, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

## 12. Termination and Modification of Services

WikiGrid reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate Services at any time, with or without notice, for any reason. This includes the availability of features, databases, or content.
